<p>processes provide a probability measure that allows us to perform
statistical inference over the space of functions. While GPs are nice as
mathematical objects when we need to implement them in practice we often
run into issues. In this worksheet we will do a little bit of a
whirlwind tour of a couple of approaches to address these problems. We
will look at how we can address the numerical issues that often appear
and we will look at approximations to circumvent the computational cost
associated with Gaussian processes. Importantly when continuing using
these models in the course you are most likely not going to implement
them yourself but instead use some of the many excellent software
packages that exists. The methods that we describe here are going to
show you how these packages implement GPs and it will hopefully give you
an idea of the type of thinking that goes into implementation of machine
learning models.</p>
